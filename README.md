# Plan for designing and making the device:

1. Collected data sheets of potential components

3. Put all components on a breadboard and run the test firmware
4. Choose electroni components to use
5. Draw several sketches of the device itself, with Phone, in hands
6. Make 3d-models of standard components
7. Asseble all standard components in general assembly
8. Model a boundry box of the device according to sketches
9. Refine the 3d-model of the device
10. Create a 3d-model of an enclosure of the divice in accordance with its 3d-Model
11. Convert parts to STL or 3dmf format
12. Slice parts and send to 3d-print
13. Put all the components inside the enclosure and if somethind doesn't fit, andjust the model and reprint.
14. Improve firmware
15. Test with user.
